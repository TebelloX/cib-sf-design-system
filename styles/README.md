# CSS folder

This library should include only components which have approved patterns in SLDS. From time to time, a need arises to included CSS that is not yet in SLDS. This folder is for that purpose. _Please use sparingly_ and immediately create an issue to remove any files from this folder once they are included in SLDS.
